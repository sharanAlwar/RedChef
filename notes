Project Name: RedChef

Tech Stack:
- Frontend: React (Dark Mode UI, styled with RedBull-inspired energy)
- Backend: Python FastAPI
- AI Model: DeepSeek Bedrock instance for generating cuisine and cooking steps

Objective:
Build an application where users input a list of food items, and the system responds with:
- A creative and attractive cuisine name
- Step-by-step instructions to prepare that dish
- The steps should reflect the tone, flair, and precision of Gordon Ramsay’s cooking style

Frontend Requirements:
- Dark mode theme with high-energy, bold visuals (like RedBull branding)
- Application title prominently displayed: RedChef
- An input field where the user can:
  - Enter multiple food ingredients (one per line or comma-separated)
- A submit button: “Cook with RedChef”
- Output display section that shows:
  - The generated cuisine name in a stylish, attention-grabbing font
  - A list of preparation steps, written with professional chef-level detail and personality (inspired by Gordon Ramsay)
- Responsive and modern UI, mobile-friendly

Backend Requirements:
- Expose a POST endpoint `/generate-recipe` that receives a JSON payload:
  {
    "ingredients": ["chicken", "garlic", "lemon", "thyme"]
  }
- Process the input and forward it to the DeepSeek Bedrock model with a structured prompt
- Return a JSON response:
  {
    "cuisine_name": "Fiery Lemon-Thyme Inferno",
    "steps": [
      "1. Preheat your oven to 200°C (400°F). Get it blazing hot!",
      "2. Take that chicken, pat it dry, and season it like you mean it with salt, pepper, and a punch of thyme.",
      "... more steps ..."
    ]
  }

AI Model Prompting Requirements:
- Format prompt to instruct the model clearly:
  - Output a unique and exciting name for a cuisine based on the ingredients
  - Generate step-by-step cooking instructions
  - Language should be confident, energetic, slightly dramatic, and culinary-professional
  - Gordon Ramsay-style tone (bold, direct, engaging)

Example Prompt to Model:
Given the ingredients: chicken, garlic, lemon, thyme

Generate:
1. A creative, attractive cuisine name that would excite a professional chef or foodie.
2. Detailed cooking instructions in Gordon Ramsay's tone—precise, high-energy, and professional.

Respond in JSON:
{
  "cuisine_name": "Your amazing dish name",
  "steps": [
    "Step 1...",
    "Step 2...",
    ...
  ]
}
